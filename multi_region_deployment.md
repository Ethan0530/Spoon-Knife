# Multi-Region Deployment with Load Balancing

## Architecture Diagram

![Multi-Region Deployment Architecture](/mnt/data/multi_region_architecture.png)

## Description

This architecture ensures **high availability** and **load balancing** across multiple regions.
- **Global Load Balancer**: Directs traffic to the healthiest region.
- **Region Load Balancers**: Handle local traffic distribution.
- **Web Server VMs**: Frontend servers replicated across regions.
- **SQLVM Database**: Primary and secondary database instances with automatic failover.
- **Database Replication & Sync**: Ensures data consistency across regions.
- **Automatic Failover Mechanism**: Minimizes downtime in case of failures.
- **DNS Failover & Traffic Management**: Ensures traffic is directed to the available services.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: AWS CloudWatch and Security Hub for tracking system health.

This architecture guarantees **resilience, redundancy, and minimal downtime** during regional failures.
